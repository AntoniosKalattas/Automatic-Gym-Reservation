### Gym Reservation Automation Script

This script automates the process of making gym reservations through the University of Cyprus sports center online reservation system. Utilizing Selenium WebDriver, it simulates a user navigating through the website to select the gym, agree to terms, choose a date and time, and complete the reservation. The script is designed to handle common issues like missing elements, providing helpful error messages when such issues are encountered. Additionally, it incorporates a `tqdm` progress bar to visually track the completion of each step, enhancing user feedback during the execution. This automation reduces the manual effort required to make reservations, ensuring a more efficient and error-free booking process.
